# PRODIGY_DS_01
Population Age Distribution Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that visualizes the age distribution of a population using a histogram. The dataset used for this analysis is provided as a CSV file.

Dataset
The dataset (`population_data.csv`) consists of two columns:
- `ID`: A unique identifier for each individual.
- `Age`: The age of each individual in the population.

Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy

Code Description
The dataset is loaded using pandas.
A histogram is created using matplotlib to visualize the age distribution of the population.
The histogram shows the frequency of individuals in different age groups, which are binned in 5-year intervals.

Running the Code
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/1903VISHAL20/PRODIGY_DS_01.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd PRODIGY_DS_01

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Run the notebook to generate the age distribution histogram.
