Dataset
The dataset (`population_data.csv`) consists of two columns:
- `ID`: A unique identifier for each individual.
- `Age`: The age of each individual in the population.

Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
